# Introduction: Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains various implementations of Data Structures and Algorithm concepts in different programming languages.
The idea is to get more adept at DSA concepts, while also using that as an opportunity to dabble in different languages.
For now, I don't think I'd include Leetcode problems in this repository, but this is also subject to change in the future.

## Languages implemenation is to be done in:
+ Java (RIP).
+ Python.
+ Typescript.
+ Go

## Resources used:
The primary resource for learning DSA is going to be the **CLSR** book. Other resources that I picked up along the way would be
put in the "others" category.

## Structure
Essentially each concept that is to be implemented would be a sub-directory, with each also containing a sub-directory of the languages
used for that particular implementation. If time permits, some implementations would also have custom test cases. This structure is tentative.
