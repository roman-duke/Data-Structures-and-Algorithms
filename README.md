# Introduction: Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains various implementations of Data Structures and Algorithm concepts in different programming languages.
The idea is to get more adept at DSA concepts, while also using that as an opportunity to dabble in different languages.

## Languages implemenation is to be done in:
- Java (RIP).
- Python.
- Typescript.
- Go

## Resources used:
- The primary resource for learning DSA is going to be the **CLSR** book.
- **Others (mainly for practice and random fiddling)**
  - Advent of Code Problems.
  - Leetcode problems, as can be found on my [profile](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/submissions/1522617401/).

## Structure
Essentially each concept that is to be implemented would be a sub-directory, with each also containing a sub-directory of the languages
used for that particular implementation. If time permits, some implementations would also have custom test cases. This structure is tentative.
